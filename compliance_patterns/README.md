# 🏛️ Governance Templates

This folder provides **ready-to-use governance scaffolding** for AI and data platforms.  
Each template ensures that **compliance, ethics, and reproducibility** are embedded directly into the system lifecycle — from experimentation to production deployment.

## 📜 1. Model Cards

* **Purpose**: Document intended use, assumptions, and limitations.  
* **Contents**:  
  - Model name + version.  
  - Training dataset description.  
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, bias measures).  
  - Known risks + mitigations.  
* **Example (Markdown template)**:
  ```markdown
  # Model Card: Intent Classifier v2
  **Intended Use:** Classify call transcripts into predefined intents.  
  **Training Data:** 1M call records (de-identified).  
  **Metrics:** Accuracy = 92%, F1 = 0.88.  
  **Limitations:** Lower performance for non-English audio.  
  **Ethical Notes:** Biased toward high-volume U.S. call center patterns.
  ```

## ✅ 2. Compliance Checklist Template

* **GDPR / HIPAA hooks**:  
  - Right-to-forget implemented?  
  - Retention policy aligned with regulation?  

* **Auditability**:  
  - Append-only logs in place?  
  - Lineage tracing available?  

* **Fairness**:  
  - Bias tested on protected attributes?  
  - Explainability available for key decisions?  

* **Operational**:  
  - Disaster recovery and rollback tested?  
  - Cost/performance benchmarks documented?

## 🚦 3. Approval Gates

* **Pre-deployment sign-offs** required from:  
  - Data Privacy Officer (PII/PHI checks).  
  - Compliance / Legal (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX).  
  - Engineering Lead (scalability & observability).  
  - Business Owner (fit-for-purpose confirmation).  

* **MLflow integration**: models cannot be promoted to `Production` stage unless checklists + approvals are attached.

---

## 📊 4. Monitoring & Reporting Templates

* **Dashboards**:  
  - Drift detection (input vs training distribution).  
  - Latency + cost per request.  
  - Fairness KPIs.  

* **Scheduled Reports**:  
  - Monthly compliance summaries for leadership.  
  - Audit-ready PDF exports with lineage diagrams.

## 🏆 Why This Matters

Governance templates ensure that compliance is **not optional or manual**, but **codified in repeatable workflows**.  
This enables AI programs to **scale responsibly**, win regulator trust, and avoid costly production surprises.
